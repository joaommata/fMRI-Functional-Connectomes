# 🧠 Functional Connectomes
  This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled `FunctionalConnectomes.ipynb`, focusing on the analysis and modeling of functional connectomes within neurobiological networksFunctional connectomes represent the dynamic patterns of neural interactions and are crucial for understanding brain function and behavior

## 📖 Overview
  The notebook provides an unsupervised approach to learn dynamic affinities between neurons in live, behaving animal. It employs pairwise non-linear affinities between neuronal traces from brain-wide calcium activity, organized by non-negative tensor factorization (NTF. Each factor specifies groups of neurons most likely interacting during inferred intervals, facilitating the revelation of dynamic functional connectome.   This method allows for the identification of neural motifs active during different experimental stages, such as stimulus application or spontaneous behavior.    

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Affinity Learning:*   Utilizes unsupervised learning techniques to capture time-varying neuronal interaction.
- **Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF):*   Applies NTF to organize neuronal activity data, highlighting functional motif.
- **Community Detection:*  Implements weighted community detection to infer dynamic functional connectome.
